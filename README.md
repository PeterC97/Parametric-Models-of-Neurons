# Parametric-and-Nonparametric-Models-of-Neurons

This project was completed for my University of Toronto Neural Engineering Class where we coded and investigated the parametric and nonparametric models of neurons using various systems and theories, such as FitzHugh Nagumo Coupled Oscillators, Wiener-bose Models, and higher-order Volterra Models. 

NOTE: This Project uses a slightly modified verision of Lysis 7.1 provided by USC Biomedical Simulations Resource, created by Marmarelis, V.Z. All the original source code is property of USC.
